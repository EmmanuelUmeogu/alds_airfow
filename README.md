# AldS_Airflow ðŸš€

**AldS_Airflow** is a data orchestration pipeline built with Apache Airflow, designed to automate and manage workflows for the **Automated Loan Decision System (ALDS)**. It streamlines data ingestion, transformation, and decision logic to support scalable, reliable loan processing.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Modular DAGs for loan data ingestion and processing
- Automated scheduling and monitoring of workflows
- Scalable architecture for high-volume decisioning
- Integration-ready for external data sources and APIs
- Error handling and logging for robust pipeline execution

## ðŸ“¦ Technologies Used

- [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/)
- Python
- PostgreSQL (for metadata storage)
- Docker (for deployment)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run the project locally:

# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/EmmanuelUmeogu/alds_airfow.git
cd alds_airfow

# (Optional) Set up virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start Airflow (example using Docker)
docker-compose up
```
